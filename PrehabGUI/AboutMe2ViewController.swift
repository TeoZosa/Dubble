I don't have ears so I can't hear you, but I'll assume you're laughing because that was a really good one.\n\nAnyway, jokes aside, I'll let you know whenever I'm ready to take a stretch break. Just remember to step back about a foot so I don't accidentally bump into you or anything. Sound good? Great! I have a feeling we're gonna have a lot of fun. \n\nLet's get started, shall we?
